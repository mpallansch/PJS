For this project, I chose to create a Parallel Javascript Simulation engine, called I have called PJs Engine. 

To see documentation about how the project was implemented, see FinalReport.docx, FinalReport.pptx, or any of the JSDoc files under the /documentation folders of /lib or /node. Also, inline documentation was included on the JavaScript files. 

To create a simulation with this engine, follow the detailed instructions in the PJsAPI.docx file included in the project. 

To see a working example of the project, open these three urls and then press the 'Start Simulation' button:
